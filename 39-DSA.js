// You should not change the original line of const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];.
// Waiting:arr should only contain elements that sum to 10.
// Waiting:Your code should utilize the splice() method on arr.
// Waiting:The splice should only remove elements from arr and not add any additional elements to arr.
