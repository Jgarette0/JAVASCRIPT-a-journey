# JavaScript Relearning Repository

This repository serves as my personal space for relearning and reviewing JavaScript concepts. It contains a variety of files and examples that showcase different aspects of JavaScript.

Within this repository are:
- Examples demonstrating core JavaScript concepts.
- Various files showcasing topics such as functional programming, destructuring, and more.
- The presence of a `node_modules` directory, which is meant for runtime purposes.

This repository is solely dedicated to my ongoing journey of revisiting and strengthening my understanding of JavaScript. It's a place for me to experiment, practice, and track my progress in relearning this programming language.

Happy coding and learning! ðŸŒŸ
